## The use case diagram visualizes the interactions between actors (Guest, Host, Admin) and the Airbnb's backend functionalities.
## Actors are shown as text labels on the left.
## Use cases are grouped into color-coded modules (e.g., lightyellow for User Management, lightgreen for Property Management) for clarity.
## Key functionalities include Sign Up, Login, Create Booking, Make Payment, and Manage Content, represented as ovals.
## Solid lines connect actors to use cases they interact with (e.g., Guest to Create Booking).
## Dashed lines with "<<include>>" labels show dependencies (e.g., Cheking Availability before Creating a Booking).
