## Summary

Each user story outlines key goals and interactions for the three main user roles:

- **Guest**: Register, book properties, make payments, message hosts, and leave reviews.
- **Host**: Register, list and manage properties, respond to bookings, and message guests.
- **Admin**: Moderate users, listings, and reviews to ensure platform quality.

These stories guide feature development and ensure the platform meets real user needs.
